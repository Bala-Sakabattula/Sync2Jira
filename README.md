# Webhook Sync2Jira

This is a fork of [this](https://github.com/release-engineering/Sync2Jira/tree/master/sync2jira) version of Sync2Jira that aims to use GitHub webhook instead of relying on the Fed Message Bus. This was created as the original Sync2Jira did not support private repos, which was something that we needed for our application.

Similar documentation can be found [here](https://sync2jira.readthedocs.io/en/master/quickstart.html).
